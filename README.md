# CypressNotes
Notes on Cypress Automation
	• Cypress directly interacts with browser, unlike selenium which interacts with browser via driver
	• Javascript is used to write test cases
	• Majorly used for websites written in angular, react, vue.
	• Cypress test cases using Mocha framework (Mocha, Jasmine are frameworks are a unittest frameworks for javascript
	• Multi browser testing can be used easily using test runner
	• We can also run test cases via terminal instead of test runner - 
	• node_modules\.bin\cypress open - Command to open test runner
	• node_modules\.bin\cypress run - to run test cases via command prompt - running in headless mode
	• node_modules\.bin\cypress run --headed - to make the execution headed
	• Running a single test case - node_modules\.bin\cypress run --spec "give path by copying test case's relative path"
	• To run on a specific browser - node_modules\.bin\cypress run --browser chrome
	• All commands are present in official docs of cypress - https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/writing-your-first-test#Write-your-first-test
